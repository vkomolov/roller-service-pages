# Gulp 5 Front-End package 
## Overview
The Gulp v5 Starting Pack was constructed using modern features such as [Simplified Stream Constructions](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_simplified_construction) with
Transform stream, omitting the use of through2 and vinyl.

### Motivation:
- to get rid of annoying deprecations and vulnerabilities installing npm plugins;
- to finally apply the long-suffering Gulp version 5, hoping for its further support and development;
- 0 vulnerabilities and 0 deprecations of the chosen plugins on the current time...

Some useful and popular plugins were omitted because of their vulnerabilities and deprecations...
<br>Some plugins were replaced with the custom modules in `modules` folder.
<br>Anyway, the pack is recommended to add with additional plugins for the operations with the files, images (svg sprites), etc...
<br>Presently this package is equipped with the basic frontend needs: HTML, SCSS, ES6, image optimizations with the conversion to webp and automation of the alternative versions in html, etc...

### Notes
- The root html files and scss files, linked to them, must have the same basename: it is necessary for the correct work 
of `purgeCss` to remove the unused style selectors which are not found in the attached html file of the same name;
- `gulp-rename` was replaced to the custom module `CustomRenameFile`  //deprecations with fs.stats;
- `postcss-preset-env` is included in `cssnano`;
- `autoprefixer`  is included in `cssnano`
- `through2` is redundant in favor to [Simplified Stream Construction](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_simplified_construction);
- `gulp-clean` has deprecations in dependencies and was replaced with `rimraf` with the custom async function `cleanDist` avoiding stream and cleaning the path directly;
  Advantages:
  * Directory existence check: We directly check if the directory exists, and only if it exists, we delete it.
  * No stream creation: We do not create a file stream and do not pass it through the plugin chain, which saves resources and time.
  * Performance: Faster because it only scans and deletes without any additional file processing.
- `gulp-newer` has deprecations and was replaced with the custom [CustomNewer](modules/CustomNewer.js),
<br> It uses [lru-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lru-cache) and Simplified Stream Construction.
  Advantages:
     * Full control over dependencies and logic, avoiding outdated and vulnerable packages;
     * LRU Cache efficiently manage asynchronous operations and reduce the number of file system accesses;
     * Simplified Stream Construction: Readable and maintainable code that simplifies stream processing;
     * Using modern Node.js features like stream, Transform makes the code more idiomatic and understandable;
- `gulp-ttf2woff2` has a mass of deprecations. So, You are free to install additional plugins for Your need. But here is a simple piping of fonts to dist...;
- `gulp-imagemin` has 17 vulnerabilities (9 moderate, 8 high).
<br>So it was replaced with [CustomImgOptimizer](modules/CustomImgOptimizer.js) which effectively optimizes the images of different types, using `sharp`; 
- [CustomImgConverter](modules/CustomImgConverter.js) is also a custom module which utilizes `sharp` for converting images of different types;
- `gulp-htmlmin` is replace with `gulp-htmlclean`...

### Getting Started:

- just clone the rep, then run `npm install` for dependencies;
- `npm run dev`: is used for starting development with the local server reloaded on changes..;
- `npm run build`: it makes the optimized production of files to `dist` and opens the local server with the root html file: index.html;
- `npm run pipesDev`: it simply pipes the tasks to `dist` with no local server to open in the browser;
- `npm run pipesBuild`: it simply pipes the optimized files to `dist` with no local server to open in the browser;
- `npm run clean`: is used for cleaning the `dist` folder;

***
#### HTML:
It takes all `*.html` from `.src/html/*.html` including in nested folders except `.src/html/templates/*.html`.

[gulp-file-include](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-file-include) will assemble all @@include partial html files from `from .src/html/templates/*.html` 
to the root html files in`dist/`

The [settings](gulp/settings.js) of `gulp-file-include`, located in `const fileIncludeSettings` has `context` property
for every root *.html page, which is useful for writing special data in common included *.html files...

Then it removes extra spaces and line breaks inside a tag `<img>`.  
Then it is piped to [CustomGulpWebpHtml](modules/CustomGulpWebpHtml.js) to replace the `<img>` tags 
with the alternative `srcset` with the converted webp format of the file (if exists) and the default the original `<img>`.  
Then it is beautified and written to .dist/

**NOTE!!!** No comments in html is allowed before the `<img>` tags, as `CustomGulpWebpHtml` will not convert `<img>` to `<picture><source>` structure.
***

#### CSS:

Each scss file, located in `src/scss/*.scss` (except inner directories), will be piped to `build/css` as minimized
file (with `min` prefix) and additionally not minimized version for dev convenience; 
The minimized version of css file will be loaded from the html file;

#### IMAGES:
All images inside `src/assets/img/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png,svg,gif,webp,avif}` will be piped to `dist/assets/img/`
with the included folders...
[CustomImgOptimizer](modules/CustomImgOptimizer.js) will optimize the following images: `jpeg/jpg, png, webp, avif, svg`

In production mode the [CustomImgConverter](modules/CustomImgConverter.js) will automatically convert the images `"jpg", "jpeg", "png"` 
to the alternative `webp`.
All retina images will be converted correspondingly: image@2x.jpg to image@2x.webp
